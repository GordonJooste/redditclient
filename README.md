<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The website is hosted on github pages, so its easy to visit and use by simply clicking this link: https://gordonjooste.github.io/redditclient/

Other than that, if you want to use the source code and run it locally you can just download the code and run it with npm start. 
This will host the site locally and allow you to see any changes you've made.

### Prerequisites

You need npm and you can install it like so:
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
You will also need a code editor and as its made with react, the react libraries will be used and downloaded when running the app. 
  

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GordonJooste/redditclient
  .git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the app
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project is supposed to be used as a reddit client, to view and read both posts as well as comments. As it is a minimal reddit client, you won't have access to the full features that you would have on a full blown reddit client.

At the moment most features are avaliable:
-View posts from r/popular on the "front" page
-Click any post and you'll be able to see the full text and not just a preview of the selftext
-Click any post and you'll see the comments from the post (only root comments are displayed at the moment)
-Choose between 3 subreddits, /r/popular, /r/eyebleach, /r/funny by clicking on the navbar
-The link to each article is avaliable once you've gone to the comments

Here is a wireframe of how the project is expected to look:
